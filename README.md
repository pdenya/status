This project was abandoned because of Facebook API limitations. At the time (and probably still) there is a setting on facebook where a user can disallow their timeline (and other data) from being shared with 3rd party apps used by their friends.  What this meant for Status is that when you're using the app you won't see some of your friends in the timeline.
